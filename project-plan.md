# CodeBlanks – Project Plan

## 🎯 Objective
CodeBlanks is an educational word-guessing game designed to help beginner programmers learn essential coding concepts in a fun and interactive way. It combines gamification with learning, where players guess programming-related terms across different difficulty levels.

## 👥 Target Audience
- Beginners learning programming
- Coding bootcamp students
- High school or university-level CS learners
- Anyone preparing for coding interviews or brushing up on terminology

## 🧠 Key Features
- Categorized levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- Real programming terms and concepts
- Sound effects for feedback: correct guess, incorrect guess, and level completion
- Level progress indicator (visual display of how far the user has advanced)
- Clean, responsive interface with engaging colors and interactions

## 📋 Development Tools & Stack
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Testing:** Manual QA testing (checklists, bug reports)
- **Assets:** Custom sound effects, themed visuals

## ✅ User Stories
- As a beginner, I want to guess programming terms to reinforce my learning.
- As a player, I want immediate sound feedback when I guess correctly or incorrectly.
- As a user, I want to track my level progress while playing the game.

## 🧪 QA Approach
- All functionality is tested manually using test cases
- Bugs logged in a separate `bug-report.md` file
- Focus areas: input validation, UI feedback, sound accuracy, level transitions
- QA scenarios include:
  - Empty input
  - Rapid keypresses
  - Edge cases (e.g., submitting already-guessed letters)

## 🔮 Future Plans (v2.0+)
- Add user authentication and a personal score tracker
- Store completed words in local storage
- Add hints or definitions for guessed words
- Introduce timed rounds for more challenge
- Export leaderboard or high scores
- Make Questions and Answers more challenging.
